A DCGAN is a composite model consisting of a generator and a discriminator. Such a model follows certain guidelines such as replacing the pooling layers with strided convolutions or the use of batchnorm layers in both parts and other guidelines (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434v2). The generator tries to create objects that are as authentic as possible, while the discriminator tries to recognize the objects created from the generator. This results in a game against each other, whereby both should improve. In most cases, the generator is then used and the discriminator is only used to train the generator and then discarded.
